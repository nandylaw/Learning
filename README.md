# Learning
Just learning project
Just to build some learning plans and implement them, as a full new student, i need to view some basic code from assembly language, c/c++/c#, java/js, python, ruby, perl,css,php, oracle/mySQL,etc. and then decide where to learn more and build some useful functions for myself. in honestly, actually i even don't really more names like above languages.
anyway, i have purpose, i really unsatisfy many sides from current software environments, a lot! for example, i don't like a lot security questions from the bigger and bigger OSï¼Œ and a lot hardware/memories  to use(once you open computer, even you had not doing anything). i think they are making things trouble, that is right, i mean the security software companies! they want them!because ...money maybe? and think about it, i build a original OS, like win, it take less than 6GB and take less 500MB memories(maybe 300?), then it get bigger and bigger, even i installed all applications on D partition, i found the c partition occupy over 20GB. where? windows directory over 8GB, progroam files over 6GB, even appdata over 5GB. my god, what data they need to store? oh my god, i don't need them! really, what use i need such data? i just need the pure functions from win or my applications which the had provided at the first moment! and security companies can't do any thing about it. why i need you to clean some old files or unload some controls/softwares which i can clean them by my mouse? they collects a lot infomations and everyday clean some weeds but they would not cut off the big branchs stabbed my house! because they had the knife, maybe, i think.
but, anyway, why win getting bigger and bigger? why it can't control itself? and, anyway, again, they really disappointted me.
and more, like why a navigator take over 1GB memories when it only open some simples websites? i think the websites only have less then 1000 bytes and a few pics which less then 5MB, especially they are just some thumbnails. over 100 times space they use! they hate we have such big memories for waste? so they want to slow down us? yes, i mean, they are my enemy!
my job get slower and slower because of them!
i am wasting my life!because of them.
and more...all low software. from OS to application.
i decide to change these by myself. from base!
but, actually, i don't code! yes, i don't code! you heard me.
so, just one way, learn, and learn , and learn. first of all, from html code.
i think it is enough to say!
